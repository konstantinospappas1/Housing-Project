# 🏠 Housing Data Analysis Project

## 📚 Overview
This project is based on the **Housing.csv** dataset, which contains information about house prices and their characteristics (e.g., area, location, number of bedrooms, condition, etc.).

The main goal is to **understand the factors influencing house prices** and to **build a predictive model** using **Machine Learning (XGBoost Regressor)**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Explore the relationships between housing features and property prices.  
- Build a **price prediction model** using **XGBoost**.  
- Perform **data visualization** to identify key trends and patterns.  
- Combine **SQL analysis**, **Python modeling**, and **Power BI dashboards** for a comprehensive housing market overview.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| 🐍 **Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, matplotlib)** | Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature encoding, model training and evaluation |
| 🧩 **SQL (MySQL)** | Data extraction, filtering, and aggregation |
| 📊 **Power BI** | Interactive dashboards and visual data exploration |

## 💡 Why `Housing.csv` Was Chosen
- It is a **realistic dataset** with meaningful features related to the housing market.  
- Supports **multi-dimensional analysis** (combines numerical and categorical data).  
- Ideal for **machine learning model training and evaluation**.  
- Can easily be **extended with more attributes** such as geographic or temporal data.

---

## 📈 Results
The **XGBoost model** was optimized using **Grid Search / Randomized Search** to find the best hyperparameters.  
Evaluation metrics used:
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)** — model goodness-of-fit  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** — prediction accuracy  

The final model achieved **strong predictive performance**, with a **high test R²** and a **small gap** between train and test results, indicating good generalization.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Enrich the dataset with **geographical or time-based features**.  
- Apply **feature selection** and **regularization techniques** to enhance generalization.  
- Build **real-time Power BI dashboards** connected to a SQL database.  
- Develop a **web application** (e.g., Flask or Streamlit) for live price predictions.  
- Compare model performance across **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM**.
